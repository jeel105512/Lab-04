            <p>The Hulk is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer
                Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in the debut issue of The Incredible Hulk
                (May 1962). In his comic book appearances, the character, who has dissociative identity disorder (DID),
                is primarily represented by the alter ego Hulk, a green-skinned, hulking and muscular humanoid
                possessing a limitless degree of physical strength, and the alter ego Dr. Robert Bruce Banner, a
                physically weak, socially withdrawn, and emotionally reserved physicist, both of whom typically resent
                each other.</p>
